# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My Solution

I kept things simple and only use basic css and html. There is some degree of flexbox and css grid used to center the card and create the "plan section".
